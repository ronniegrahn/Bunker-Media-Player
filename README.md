# Bunker Media Player

Bunker Media Player is a simple music player for pen and paper rpg use.
With BMP you can play up to six different audio files at the same time.
This is useful when you want to play ambient music with sound effects like rain, wind and other environmental sounds.
It is also useful for pre-loading all the music before gaming begins.
This way you can have one playlist for combat music, another for city music, a third for sewer ambience, a fourth for marketplace ambience etc.
